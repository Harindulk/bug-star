#### Hey there! Bug Star is a game created by myself (Harindu) for the 2021 GitHub Game Off Game Jam! 

#### "Bug Star" is a game based on bugs, which means you need to find the bugs that I intentionally added to the game & you need to use them to complete the levels. 

#### I am a 15-years-old self-taught student developer, and I plan to release another version of the game very soon, as I built this game while I was busy with my school work too.
